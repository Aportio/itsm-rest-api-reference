summary: Update a single comment
description: |
  Update the details of a specific comment in the comments table.
  
  Note that while our API allows for updating the type of comment (e.g. changing a COMMENT to
  a WORKNOTE), it is understood that many ITSM systems may not allow this kind of change, and
  therefore should return a 400 in that case.
